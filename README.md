ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSION

Continents And Countries of Immigrants:
General info: The data represents the countries of origin of US immigrants pertaining to three periods of immigration: before 2000, 2000-2009, and 2010 onwards. 

Analysis: 
We analyzed data taken from “Annual Number of U.S. Legal Permanent Residents, Fiscal Years 1820-2019,” “MPI’s “Migration Policy Institute tabulations of U.S.,” “Office of Immigration Statistics, Yearbook of Immigration Statistics,” from Department of Homeland Security, and “Legal Immigration to the United States, 1820-Present” provided by Migration Policy Institute. The above-identified data provided us with information related to the continents of origin and timeframe of arrival as well as the total number of immigrants who arrived in the U.S. within a specific decade and/or within the last 100 years. 

Findings:
Half (50.27%) of all immigrants are from Latin America. A third (31.40%) of all immigrants are from Asia. The remainder (16.55%) are from Europe, Africa, Oceania, Northern America.

 Type of Immigration Admission to the U.S.:
 
General info: The data represents the types of immigration, family-based, employment-based, and others including refugees and asylees, between the years 2011 and 2020.

 Analysis:
We analyzed data from Yearbook of Immigration Statistics provided by Homeland Security Department. We looked at the type of admission whether it is family-based, profession-based or comes from other political, criminal and/or economic basis. We also calculated changes in immigration from year to year to determine whether immigration numbers increased or decreased.

Findings:
After analyzing data, we determined that family sponsored admission types of immigration remain the most common type of admissions with approximately 200,000 people each year (with 2020 having the lowest amount since 2010). It is followed by employment-based admission type which averages to approx. 145,000 (having the highest number in 2013). The third most common admission is refugee type which averages to approx. 104,000.  
 
U.S. Immigration Settlement Data:
General info: The data represents which states US immigrants have settled in following immigration between the years 2010 and 2020.

 Analysis: 
We analyzed “Selected Characteristics of The Foreign-Born Population by Period of Entry Into The United States” provided by the United States Census Bureau. This data showed us numbers of immigrants who settled in the U.S. per state,  and helped us to identify most common parts of the U.S. where immigrants settle after they immigrate.

Findings:
In the years 2010-2020, over 2 million immigrants have settled in California, making it the state with the highest number of settled immigrants. New York has the second largest number of settled immigrants with nearly 1.5 million settled immigrants. Four states CA, NY, FL, and TX, are home to 52.7% of all settled immigrants in the US.

 Occupation and Education of Immigrant Population:
General info: The data represents US immigrants’ occupation and education statuses between three decades: prior to 2000, 2000-2009, and 2010 onwards.

Analysis:
We analyzed data taken from “Selected Characteristics Of The Foreign-Born Population By Period Of Entry Into The United States” provided by the United States Census Bureau. The documentation included data related to immigrant education and marital status, and is divided by age, sex and educational level. Reviewing the data, helped us to come up with the findings as detailed below.

Findings:
In the years following 2010, the number of immigrants attending school in the US nearly doubled in comparison to the prior decade. Prior to 2000, nearly 92% of school attending immigrants were in college or graduate school, whereas in the following decades there was an increased variety of school types among immigrants signifying a more age-diverse inclusion of immigrants.
